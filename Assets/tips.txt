You can swap your weapon either by using the mouse wheel, or press Q / 1 / 2
Don't stand still! Keep moving around so it's harder for the zombie to get to you
Kill the fast zombie (green zombie) first as they can be very dangerous due to the speed
Don't let the zombie group together as a horde of zombie can kill you easily!
Tank zombies (purple zombie) are hard to kill, but you can usually outrun them as they are slow 
You don't have to wait until your gun is empty, reload you weapon whatever is possible!
Avoid the toxic red mists at all cost! The insider you are in the mist, the more damage you will get
You can't shoot through the bushes, and zombie might hide under it, so be careful when standing next to a bush!
If the crosshair turns grey, it means you can't shoot right now
The zombie numbers will increase overtime as you progress, so be prepared!
If your window had lost focus, the game will automatically pause for you :)
There won't be any zombies during the tutorial, so you can familiarize the controls freely
Bushes can slow you down! So try not to walk into it
