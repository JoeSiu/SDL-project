Alright, do you hear me?
Seems you have arrived the target zone.
Before we get started, lets have a quick rehearsal again.
First, try move around the area using W, A, S, D.
Don't walk into the toxic red mist though.
//end part//
Good, now shoot your gun with left mouse button.
You can switch weapon using Q or mouse wheel also.
And remember you can't shoot through the bushes.
//end part//
Great, now reload your gun by pressing R.
//end part//
Alright enough for now... Wait whats that?
Seems the zombies are heading to your position now!
Watch out and don't let them get close to you!
//end part//
Well we don't have much time left now.
Your mission is to recover the missing signals.
But their position is unknown, you have to find it yourself.
They should be marked with a blue zone also.
//end part//
Great! Seems you have recovered all missing signals.
We are coming to rescue you.
Hold on and don't die!
//end part//
